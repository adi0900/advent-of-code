# Advent of Code by Eric Wastl

![Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/favicon.png)

Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I create **Advent of Code**, a fun and challenging set of programming puzzles that run each year during the holiday season. I hope you enjoy solving them! I'm also active on [Bluesky](https://www.bluesky.com), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social), [GitHub](https://github.com), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com).

Advent of Code is a series of small, self-contained programming puzzles designed for a variety of skill levels. They can be tackled in any programming language and have been used for:

- **Interview preparation**
- **Company training**
- **University coursework**
- **Practice problems**
- **Speed contests**
- **Friendly challenges**

No computer science background? No problem! With basic programming knowledge and problem-solving skills, you can get pretty far. Each puzzle is crafted to complete in under 15 seconds on a decade-old computer, ensuring that even the simplest setups can participate.

## How to Participate

1. **Sign up** on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
2. Choose a programming language that you prefer or want to learn.
3. Start solving the puzzles that are released daily during the Advent season.
4. Join the community to share your experiences and solutions.

## General Tips

- **Check the examples**: If you’re stuck, validate your solution with the given examples. If your output doesn’t match, double-check your approach.
- **Test cases**: Create custom test cases to ensure your solution handles edge cases.
- **Complete input**: Ensure you’re using the full input data provided for the puzzle.
- **Take breaks**: If you get stuck, step away and come back with a fresh perspective. Sometimes, asking friends or seeking hints on forums like [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode) can help.
- **Ask for help**: If you're really stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for help but avoid spoiling the solutions for others.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does authentication work?
Advent of Code uses OAuth for authentication, so you log in through a third-party service (e.g., GitHub, Reddit). You provide your credentials only to that service, not to Advent of Code, ensuring your privacy and security.

### Should I try to get on the global leaderboard?
The global leaderboard is competitive and adds an extra layer of excitement. Competing can be rewarding, but it requires skill, practice, and quick problem-solving abilities. It's fine to solve puzzles without aiming for a leaderboard spot — focus on what makes the experience valuable to you.

### Can I stream my solutions?
Yes, you can stream, but be mindful of the timing:
- **Before the global leaderboard fills up**: Avoid posting solutions if they could give others an unfair advantage.
- **After the leaderboard is full**: Streaming is generally fine.
- **AI assistance**: While using AI tools is up to you, avoid using AI to solve the puzzle in its entirety before the leaderboard is full. The focus should be on human skill development.

### Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST?
This schedule allows me to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Life gets busy with family and work, and I need rest too! If midnight isn’t convenient for you, consider forming private leaderboards with friends or local groups.

### I have a puzzle idea. Can I share it with you?
Unfortunately, due to copyright and attribution concerns, I can't accept puzzle ideas. This is to avoid any potential legal issues.
